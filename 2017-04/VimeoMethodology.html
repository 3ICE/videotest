            <p>The test was performed on theree separate Surface Book laptops running Windows 10 Creator's Update (15063.0 release). These computers were configured to the following settings, to increase consistency between measures and reduce tasks that may start during the measurement and interfere with the results, while still representing a realistic user setup:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Display brightness was set to 75%</li>
                <li>Volume was set to mute</li>

                <li>Defender was running normally and up to date</li>
                <li>Device was physically unplugged and running on battery</li>
                <li>Windows Battery Saver mode was set to activate at 20% battery</li>
                <li>The cache was cleared on each browser</li>
