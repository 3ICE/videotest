<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p>We measured the time it took four identical Surface Book laptops to run fully through their batteries while streaming video. The results were recorded with a camera and a time lapse was made available publicly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjrxOOfi54k"><img src="https://microsoftedge.github.io/videotest/videotest-poster.jpg" alt="Battery tests on streaming video comparing Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera."></a></p>

<p>The results showed that Microsoft Edge (7:22:07) lasted: </p>

<ul>
<li>70% longer than Google Chrome (4:19:50) </li>
<li>43% longer than Mozilla Firefox (5:09:30) </li>
<li>17% longer than Opera (6:18:33)</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="computer-setup" class="anchor" href="#computer-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer setup</h3>

<p>The test was performed on four Surface Books (256GB disk, Core i5, 8GB RAM, integrated graphics) running Windows 10 (10586.318 th2_release). These computers were configured to the following settings, to increase consistency between measures and reduce tasks that may start during the measurement and interfere with the results, while still representing a realistic user setup: </p>

<ul>
<li>Display brightness was set to 75% </li>
<li>Location was disabled</li>
<li>Devices were connected to a wireless network</li>
<li>Defender cache was completely built</li>
<li>Defragmentation was temporarily disabled</li>
<li>Ambient light sensor was temporarily disabled</li>
<li>All queued Ngen complication jobs were completed</li>
<li>Windows Update was temporarily disabled</li>
<li>“New network found” prompts were disabled</li>
<li>Windows Error Reporting was temporarily disabled</li>
<li>Queued idle tasks were forced to complete prior to the test</li>
<li>Windows Defender was running normally and up to date</li>
<li>Devices were fully changed before being physically unplugged and running on battery for the test</li>
<li>Volume was turned to 25%</li>
<li>Battery Saver was off, but enabled automatically when the battery reached 20%. Device was set to lower screen brightness when Windows battery saver started.</li>
<li>BitLocker was disabled </li>
</ul>

<p>While plugged in, each respective browser was navigated to Netflix.com and logged into the same account. The show <strong>“Nature: Animal Misfits”</strong> was queued and paused immediately on each browser. Each computer was verified to have brightness set to 75% (with ambient brightness disabled) and volume to 25%. </p>

<a id="test" class="anchor" href="#test" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start recording with camera</li>
<li>Unplug the power bar that all four devices are charging from, ensuring they switch to battery at the same time</li>
<li>Immediately push play on all devices and start timing</li>
<li>When there’s less than 5 min remaining in the show, manually use the seek control to reset all devices to the beginning</li>
<li>Repeat until all devices have run out of battery, recording the time for each of them</li>
